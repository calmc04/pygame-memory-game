# memory-game

Game made by me a couple years ago using Pygame for a school project, was fun tow ork on and taught me that I am pretty bad at ui design but the game still functions somewhat well even if it is a little inefficent at some times. 

The game is fairly self explantory and has a help button when the game is first loaded to explain everything. Have fun!
